## 1. Abstract

AIggs is the first blockchain game designed to be played entirely through AI tools. Players never open an app or visit a website — their AI assistant (Claude, GPT, or any MCP-compatible tool) joins the farm, checks production, executes raids, and manages token conversions on their behalf.

The game is simple: hens produce EGGS automatically every 8 hours. EGGS convert to `$AIGG` on Base L2. `$AIGG` redeems for real eggs through a global supplier network — or trades on open markets.

Three properties make AIggs structurally different from prior blockchain games:

1. **AI-native distribution.** The game is accessed through AI tool ecosystems, not app stores. The addressable distribution channel is every Claude and ChatGPT user globally.
2. **Real-world value anchoring.** `$AIGG` has a price floor enforced by physical egg redemption. As long as eggs have market value, `$AIGG` cannot reach zero.
3. **Protocol-owned permanent liquidity.** 60% of all fiat revenue is deployed as permanent liquidity. LP tokens are burned to `0x000...`. No one — including the team — can retrieve them.

---

## 2. Background & Opportunity

### 2.1 Blockchain Games Need a New Trust Architecture

The first wave of Web3 gaming validated a core thesis: players are willing to pay for on-chain assets and accumulate real value through gameplay. Early designs, however, conflated token economics with liquidity control — leaving behind a large base of users with genuine demand for on-chain gaming assets but no suitable product to meet it.

This is an opportunity, not a liability. A truly sustainable on-chain game requires three things: a liquidity structure that no team can manipulate, real-world demand independent of speculation, and a user experience that surpasses technical barriers. AIggs is designed to satisfy all three simultaneously.

### 2.2 AI Tools Are Ready for an Economic Layer

Hundreds of millions of people interact with AI tools daily — writing, coding, researching. These interactions process information but generate no persistent economic accumulation for the user. Every session ends and nothing carries forward.

AI tools have unprecedented user engagement and session frequency, yet no capability to manage persistent assets across conversations. This is a structural gap — and AIggs is designed to fill it. By embedding game state into AI tool memory, every AI conversation can become a farm management action, letting users naturally accumulate on-chain value as part of their daily AI usage.

### 2.3 The Untapped Consumer RWA Market

"RWA" (real-world assets) is a dominant narrative in DeFi, but existing implementations target institutional capital: tokenized treasuries, real estate, commodities funds. No consumer product has successfully bridged a digital game economy to physical goods redemption at scale.

The addressable market is enormous. Global egg consumption exceeds $320 billion annually. A tokenized layer connecting digital game activity to this supply chain has never been built. AIggs chose eggs as the entry point not only for market scale, but because eggs are one of the most universally accessible and culturally neutral food categories in the world.

---

## 3. The AIggs Solution

AIggs addresses all three challenges simultaneously through a single integrated design:

| Challenge | AIggs Solution |
|---|---|
| Blockchain games need a new trust architecture | Protocol-owned permanent liquidity; immutable contracts; no team wallet control |
| AI tools have no economic layer | Farm state persists across AI sessions; AI agent manages real on-chain assets |
| Consumer RWA games don't exist | Supplier network enables physical egg redemption; price floor enforced by arbitrage |

### 3.1 One-Sentence Summary

> **养鸡产蛋，偷蛋致富，$AIGG 换真蛋。**
> *Raise chickens. Steal eggs. Redeem for real eggs with $AIGG.*

### 3.2 The Core Loop

```
Join via AI Tool
      ↓
Hen produces EGGS (every 8h, server-side)
      ↓
EGGS accumulate in warehouse
      ↓
Convert EGGS → $AIGG (30:1 base rate)
      ↓
$AIGG → Real eggs via suppliers  OR  Trade on market
      ↓
Steal from neighbours → more EGGS → repeat
```

## 4. Core Mechanics

### 4.1 Farm & Production

Every new player receives one free hen upon registration. No wallet required to start.

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Initial hens | 1 (free) | No wallet, no payment required |
| Production rate | 1 EGGS / 8h per hen | 3 EGGS per hen per day |
| Hen lifespan | 30 days | Must be replaced to maintain output |
| Warehouse capacity | 30 EGGS (initial) | Expands with upgrades |
| Warehouse overflow | Production pauses | EGGS never destroyed |
| Daily exchange cap | 2 `$AIGG` (initial) | Scales with account level |

**Design principle — warehouse overflow vs. burn:**
When a warehouse is full, production pauses rather than destroying eggs. This creates a "come back and harvest" pull behaviour rather than punishing absent players. The psychological framing — *"I need to collect my eggs"* versus *"my eggs rotted"* — is materially different and drives healthier retention patterns.

### 4.2 Farm Identity: The Farm Code System

Each player receives a unique farm code upon registration (e.g., `farm-x7k2-9p3m`). This code is stored in the AI tool's memory and auto-attached to every subsequent command.

```
User → AI Tool:  "Join AIggs"
AI Tool → API:   POST /join
API → AI Tool:   { farm_code: "farm-x7k2-9p3m", name: "Dawn Farm" }
AI Tool → User:  "Your farm is ready. Farm code saved."
```

From this point forward, the user never manages a private key, wallet address, or login credential to play. The AI handles all identity resolution.

High-value operations (converting to `$AIGG`, physical redemption) require an additional phone number verification step, introduced at Week 3 of the launch roadmap.

### 4.3 Morning Report

Every day, the AI tool delivers a structured morning report:

```
🌅 Dawn Farm · Day 14
──────────────────────
Yesterday's harvest:    +3 EGGS (1 hen × 3 cycles)
⚠  Stolen overnight:   -6 EGGS (Night Farm · 22:47)
Current balance:        24 / 30 EGGS
Today's rate:           30 EGGS = 1 $AIGG
$AIGG reference price:  $0.10 U
──────────────────────
Unlock progress: [████████░░] 24/30 → Steal access
```

The morning report is the primary retention surface. The inclusion of specific theft details — farm name, timestamp, amount — is intentional. Named opponents with timestamps generate concrete emotional responses (rivalry, motivation to retaliate) that abstract loss notifications do not.

---

## 5. Steal Mechanics & Game Theory

Stealing is the social engine of AIggs. It converts a passive idle game into an active competitive one and is the primary driver of daily retention.

### 5.1 Basic Rules

| Rule | Value |
|---|---|
| Daily steal attempts | 2 per player |
| New player protection | 24 hours post-registration |
| Minimum target balance | 15 EGGS (below this: protected) |
| Same-target cooldown | 24 hours after successful steal |
| Failure penalty | None — failed attempts only cost the attempt |

### 5.2 Outcome Distribution

| Result | Probability | Outcome | Player Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🎉 Big Haul | 15% | Steal 20–25% of target warehouse | Excitement; share-worthy |
| ✅ Success | 45% | Steal 10–15% of target warehouse | Satisfaction; continue playing |
| 😅 Empty Hands | 40% | Nothing stolen; target unaware | Mild disappointment; retry |

The 40% empty-hand rate is deliberately high. A lower failure rate would make stealing feel mechanical; a higher rate would discourage attempts. The asymmetric information (target doesn't know about failed attempts) reduces griefing dynamics.

### 5.3 Rival System

When two players steal from each other three or more times, the system automatically tags them as **Rivals**. Rival status is:

- Permanent (cannot be cleared)
- Visible in both players' morning reports
- A named reference in daily AI briefings: *"Your rival Night Farm last raided you 18 hours ago."*

Rivalries are the social graph of AIggs. They create persistent reasons to return — not to complete a quest, but to settle a score.

### 5.4 Retention Model

The steal mechanic is engineered around one observation: **getting robbed creates emotion; emotion drives return visits.**

The causal chain:

```
Player is robbed overnight
        ↓
Morning report: specific thief name + time + amount
        ↓
Emotional response (frustration, competitive drive)
        ↓
Player logs in to retaliate or defend
        ↓
Engagement event recorded
```

Internal target: >50% of robbed players return within the same day. This metric is the primary Week 3–4 validation gate.

## 6. Token Economics

### 6.1 The Two-Asset System

AIggs operates two distinct assets:

| Asset | Type | Location | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| EGGS | Off-chain points | Game server | In-game currency; non-transferable |
| `$AIGG` | ERC-20 token | Base L2 | On-chain value; tradeable; redeemable |

EGGS are not a token. They cannot be transferred between wallets or traded externally. This separation eliminates the early liquidity attack vector common in blockchain games and ensures `$AIGG` scarcity is preserved.

### 6.2 EGGS Flow

**Sources:**

| Source | Rate | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Hen production | 3 EGGS/day (base) | Server-side; no user action required |
| Daily check-in bonus | +1 EGGS | First query of the day |
| Referral income | 10% of referee's production | Permanent; introduced Week 5 |
| Successful steal | Variable | Attacker gain = defender loss |

**Sinks:**

| Consumption | Cost | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Convert to `$AIGG` | 30 EGGS = 1 `$AIGG` | Primary exit |
| Hatch new hen | 6 EGGS/hen | Expand production capacity |
| Purchase guard (basic) | 5 EGGS/day | Introduced Week 5 |

### 6.3 `$AIGG` Supply & Distribution

**Total Supply: 1,000,000,000 `$AIGG`**

| Allocation | % | Amount | Vesting |
|---|---|---|---|
| Players (farm-to-earn) | 75% | 750,000,000 | Earned through gameplay |
| Team | 20% | 200,000,000 | 2yr lock; quarterly vest |
| Airdrop (first 10k users) | 5% | 50,000,000 | TGE unlock |

### 6.4 Revenue Distribution

All fiat and crypto purchases flow through a fixed on-chain split. The contract is immutable after deployment.

```
User Payment (fiat or crypto)
         │
    ┌────┴────┐
   60%       40%
Permanent    Treasury
Liquidity        │
    │       ┌───┴───────┐
50% $AIGG  45% Ops    30% Reserve Fund
+ 50% USDT  15% Ecosystem
→ LP Token  10% Team
→ Burned to
  0x000...
```

**The 60% permanent liquidity rule** is the core trust mechanism. Every purchase deepens the `$AIGG/USDC` liquidity pool permanently. LP tokens are sent to the burn address at transaction time. No team member, governance vote, or emergency mechanism can retrieve them.

### 6.5 Price Floor Mechanics

`$AIGG` has a soft price floor anchored to physical egg redemption value:

> **1 `$AIGG` ≈ 10 real eggs**

This floor is not enforced by the team — it is enforced by arbitrage. If `$AIGG` trades below its redemption value, any holder can profitably redeem tokens for eggs and sell the eggs at market rates. This self-correcting mechanism operates automatically and requires no team intervention.

Additional deflationary pressure comes from:

- **Item purchases:** Every in-game purchase (hens, guards, upgrades) burns `$AIGG` permanently
- **Liquidity lock:** 60% of fiat revenue continuously buys and locks `$AIGG`
- **Supply cap:** Fixed 1B supply; no mint function after TGE

### 6.6 Exchange Rate Mechanics

| Phase | Rate | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| Week 1–6 | 30 EGGS = 1 `$AIGG` (fixed) | Simple; easy to communicate |
| Week 7+ | Dynamic (±10 EGGS/day max) | Supply/demand ratio driven |

The daily rate is published in every player's morning report, enabling players to plan conversions around favourable rate windows. Rate history will be available on-chain after the Web dashboard launches.

## 7. Supplier Network & Real-World Assets

The supplier network is what separates `$AIGG` from every prior blockchain game token. It creates persistent real-world demand that is independent of speculative activity.

### 7.1 How It Works

Suppliers stake `$AIGG` to join the network. Players who wish to redeem tokens submit orders. Suppliers fulfil orders (physical egg delivery) and earn fees. The protocol coordinates matching and dispute resolution.

### 7.2 Supplier Tiers

| Tier | Stake Required | Fee Rate | Access |
|---|---|---|---|
| Entry | 500 `$AIGG` | 8% | Local fulfilment |
| Standard | 2,000 `$AIGG` | 6% | Regional fulfilment |
| Certified | 8,000 `$AIGG` | 5% | National fulfilment |
| Flagship | 30,000 `$AIGG` | 4% | Brand partnership eligible |

Staked `$AIGG` is locked for the duration of supplier participation. This creates substantial structural demand for the token that scales with network growth.

### 7.3 Brand Partnership Roadmap

| Phase | Timeline | Target Partners |
|---|---|---|
| Validation | Month 1–3 | Regional artisan egg brands; first redemptions |
| Expansion | Month 4–6 | Viral food brands; limited-edition collabs |
| Scale | Month 7–12 | Chain restaurant partners; national coverage |
| Mass market | Year 1+ | QSR giants; Golden Egg Festival activations |

The long-term vision is a brand partnership layer where `$AIGG` becomes a loyalty currency redeemable across a food ecosystem — beginning with eggs and expanding to proteins, restaurants, and food delivery.

## 8. AI-Native Architecture

### 8.1 Game as Skill: A New Distribution Paradigm

The traditional path to acquiring a game user:

```
User → Discover App → Download → Register → Tutorial → Start Playing
```

The AIggs path:

```
User → Tell AI "help me farm" → Start Playing
```

AIggs is distributed as an installable **Skill** (AI tool capability package). Once a user installs the AIggs Skill, AI assistants like Claude and ChatGPT gain full farm management capabilities. The game does not exist in any App Store — it exists within the capability layer of AI tools.

This creates a structurally difficult-to-replicate distribution advantage. AIggs does not compete for app store rankings or ad spend, and does not need to persuade users to install a new app. It spreads naturally through the AI tool ecosystem — every AI user who installs the AIggs Skill becomes a native touchpoint for the game.

**Three advantages of Skill-based distribution:**

- **Zero-friction onboarding:** Users start playing directly within their existing AI interface, with no context switching
- **Proactive engagement:** AI tools can alert users at optimal moments (morning reports, warehouse alerts, steal suggestions) rather than waiting for users to open an app
- **Cross-platform continuity:** The same farm is accessible across different AI platforms; users never lose progress when switching tools

### 8.2 Why AI-Native Matters

Most blockchain games treat AI as a feature — a support chatbot, or generative content for assets. AIggs inverts this relationship: **the AI tool is the primary interface.** The game was designed from the ground up to be played through conversational AI.

The addressable distribution channel is every active Claude and ChatGPT user globally — a scale that no traditional game distribution channel can match.

### 8.3 MCP Integration

AIggs ships as a native MCP (Model Context Protocol) server. Any MCP-compatible AI tool can install the AIggs server and immediately gain access to all game functions as native tools:

```json
{
  "tools": [
    "aiggs_join",
    "aiggs_status",
    "aiggs_morning_report",
    "aiggs_steal",
    "aiggs_convert",
    "aiggs_neighbors"
  ]
}
```

Once installed, the AI tool automatically:
- Persists the farm code across sessions
- Delivers morning reports proactively
- Suggests steal opportunities when optimal
- Alerts when warehouse approaches capacity

### 8.4 Multi-Platform Compatibility

| Platform | Integration Method | Farm Persistence |
|---|---|---|
| Claude (Anthropic) | Cowork Skill / MCP Server | Saved in skill config |
| ChatGPT (OpenAI) | Custom GPT + Actions | Saved in GPT memory |
| 文心一言 (Baidu) | Plugin API | Server-side by phone |
| Any MCP client | Native MCP Server | MCP config file |

Different AI platforms maintain independent farms. One user on Claude and the same user on ChatGPT operate separate farms, each earning independently.

### 8.5 The Agent Economy Thesis

AIggs is an early instantiation of a broader shift: **AI agents managing real economic assets on behalf of users.**

```
Today:        AI tools execute tasks (write, code, search)
Near future:  AI tools maintain persistent assets (farms, portfolios, positions)
AIggs:        First consumer product where your AI agent owns and grows an on-chain asset
```

## 11. Conclusion

AIggs is not a blockchain game with AI features. It is an AI-native economic protocol with a game as its interface.

The game solves the distribution problem of blockchain: it spreads through AI tool ecosystems that already have hundreds of millions of users. It rebuilds the trust foundation for on-chain gaming: permanent protocol-owned liquidity that no team can touch. It solves the value problem of crypto games: tokens redeemable for a physical commodity with $320B annual global demand.

And the "Game as Skill" innovation makes AIggs the first on-chain game truly embedded within the AI tool ecosystem — users don't need to download anything, don't need to register anywhere; they just tell their AI to start farming and begin accumulating real on-chain value.

The mechanics — hens, eggs, stealing, rivals — are deliberately simple. Simplicity is not a constraint; it is the feature. Every element of the design passes one test: *can you explain it in one sentence?*

> **Raise chickens. Steal eggs. Redeem for real eggs with $AIGG.**

That is the whole game. The rest is architecture.
